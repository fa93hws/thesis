\chapter{Quad-tree mesh in 2D analysis}
\label{qdt_sec:main}
\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
The main objective of this chapter is to introduce a way that can utilize the engineering design available in the AutoCAD or other popular commercial softwares for 2D cases.
The data format that used in almost all engineering design softwares that can represent the geometry exactly is IGES file.
It will be used as a bridge between design and numerical analysis.
%
\paragraph{}
After the NURBS information representing the exact geometry has been extracted from the IGES file, the quad-tree mesh generation algorithm described in \ref{qt_sc:quadtree} will be adopted to generate a high quality mesh.
Either the NURBS basis functions or the traditional shape functions can be used as the shape function of the SBFEM solver.
% We further extend the method to problems with singularities within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics.
The proposed method enhances the conventional SBFEM and the salient features of the method are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No human effort involvement in mesh generation
        \item Retained exact geometry
        \item High quality mesh generated from the quad-tree algorithm
    \end{itemize}
\paragraph{}
This chapter is organized as follows.
The CAD output (iges files) will be introduced first.
After that, an overview of the algorithm that can generate quadtree mesh will be provided.
Furthermore, a point projection which project intersection point back to the NURBS surface is presented.
The accuracy and the convergence properties of the proposed techniques are demonstrated with benchmark problems in the context of linear elasticity, followed by concluding remarks in the last section.

\section{Conclusions}
In this chapter, we employed the IGES file directly from the CAD output to generate the quadtree mesh automatically.
The accuracy, effectiveness and the convergence properties of the proposed method are demonstrated with benchmark problems in linear elasticity mechanics.
From the numerical studies, it can be observed that the quadtree mesh yield better accuracy when compared to uniform mesh with same degree of freedoms.
The proposed methods provides a systematic and automatic mesh generation algorithm that can produce high quality mesh.
CAD design file can be used directly and the exact geometry can also be retained, which can largely reduce human efforts involved in numerical analysis.
Moreover, it can also help to reduce the analytical error as the difference in the geometric representation is minimized.
Computational efficiency can also be improved via utilizing the pattern of the quadtree.
