\chapter{Quad-tree mesh in 2D analysis}

\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
The main objective of this chapter is to introduce a way that can utilize the engineering design available in CAD or other popular commercial softwares for 2D case.
The data format that used in almost all engineering design softwares that can represent the geometry exactly is IGES file.
It will be used as a bridge between design and numerical analysis.

\paragraph{}
After the NURBS represented exact geometry has been extracted from the IGES file, a quad-tree mesh generation algorithm described in \ref{qt_sc:quadtree} will be adopted to generate high quality mesh.
Either the NURBS basis functions or the traditional shape function can be used as the shape function of the SBFEM solver.
% We further extend the method to problems with singularities within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics.
The proposed method enhances the conventional SBFEM and the salient features of the method are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No human effort need to generate the mesh
        \item Exact geometry will be retain
        \item High quality mesh from the quad-tree algorithm
    \end{itemize}
