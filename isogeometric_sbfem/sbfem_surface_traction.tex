\section{Surface traction}
\label{iso_section:surface_traction}
\paragraph{}
In structural analysis, it is common to have boundary conditions such as displacement constraints and applied loads.
Due to the property of the NURBS that the control points are not necessarily on the curve, surface tractions can not be applied by the same method used in conventional numerical method like FEM or SBFEM.
A surface traction $\Phi$ can be regarded as a Neumann boundary condition which can be expressed as
    \begin{equation}
        {F}=-\int_{\Gamma}
        [N]
        \Phi_n
        d\Gamma
    \label{iso_eq:neumann_bc}
    \end{equation}
where $[N]$ describe the shape functions and $\Phi_n$ is the surface tractions on the nodes.

\paragraph{}
As mentioned in \hl{Sec.}~\ref{iso_section:numerical_integration}, numerical integration would be preferred over mathematical deduction when the target function is an input.
In the flavour of numerical integration, Eq.~\ref{iso_eq:neumann_bc} can be expressed as followed.
    \begin{equation}
        {F}=-\sum_{i=1}^n
        a_i
        [N(\xi_i)]
        \Phi_n
    \label{iso_eq:neumann_bc_numerical}
    \end{equation}
where $\xi_i$ is the integration point and $a_i$ is the weight,
$n$ is the number of integration points and different quadrature rules require different number of points in order to achieve an optimal accuracy.

\paragraph{}
It can be found that the term $[N(\xi_i)] \Phi_n$ is corresponding to $f(x)$ in Eq.~\ref{iso_eq:numerical_integration}.
In conventional FEM or SBFEM, $\Phi_n$ can be determined as the real values on the nodes because, geometrically speaking, its shape function is interpolated from the given set of points.
In other words, all nodes that determine the shape function in traditional FEM or SBFEM must be on the interpolating function.
However, this is not the case in NURBS curves where it is the control points that play the same role as the nodes in existing shape function.
In NURBS curves, apart from the first and the last points, the control points are not necessarily on the curves as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{lr_fig:nurbs_knotins}.
This prevent\hl{s} us from adopting physical value\hl{s} on the nodes as $\Phi_n$ in Eq.~\ref{iso_eq:neumann_bc_numerical}.
Instead, a set of ``control stress'' $\Phi_c$, the control points of another NURBS curve that represent the surface traction geometrically, need to be determined as 
    \begin{equation}
        \Phi_c = \argmin_{\Phi_c}
            \frac{1}{2}
            \int_{-1}^1
            \|
                \Phi(\xi)-
                    \left[ N(\xi) \right]
                    \Phi_c
            \|^2
            d\xi            
    \label{iso_eq:surface_traction_fitting}
    \end{equation}
%
It means that ``control stress'' $\Phi_c$ describe a minimum mean squared error between surface traction NURBS curve and the real traction $\Phi$.
One of the simplest mathematical method\hl{s} to determine $\Phi_c$ will be the least square method.
Given the fact that the shape functions of this NURBS curve will be the same as that describe the geometry, $\left[ N(\xi) \right]$ can be considered as known.
By selecting $n$ sample points over the domain of the $\Phi$, Eq.~\ref{iso_eq:surface_traction_fitting} can be rewrite as
    \begin{equation}
        \Phi_c = \argmin_{\Phi_c}
            \frac{1}{n}
            \sum_{i=1}^n
            \|
                \Phi(\xi_i)-
                    \left[ N(\xi_i) \right]
                    \Phi_c
            \|^2
    \label{iso_eq:surface_traction_fitting_discrete}
    \end{equation}
Then ``control stress'' $\Phi_c$ can be solved by least square as
    \begin{equation}
        \Phi_c= \left(
            \left[ N(\xi) \right] ^T
            \left[ N(\xi) \right]
        \right)^{-1}
        \left[ N(\xi) \right]^T
        \Phi(\xi)
    \end{equation}
and Eq.~\ref{iso_eq:neumann_bc_numerical} in the case where NURBS is in use can be rewrite as
    \begin{equation}
        {F}=-\sum_{i=1}^n
        a_i
        [N(\xi_i)]
        \Phi_c
    \label{iso_eq:neumann_bc_numerical_NURBS}
    \end{equation}
