\paragraph{}
Having a few error indicator may not be a good story as some of them can be correlated to each others and contribute little to decided whether a cell need to be refined.
As a result, some multivariate analysis technique is required to find out a set of most significant variables.

\paragraph{}
Principal component analysis(PCA) is a method in multivariate analysis that achieve dimension reduction.
With keeping most of the information, the origin set of variables can be reduced to a smaller one.
It will transform the origin set of variable which may be correlated to another smaller number of variables that are orthogonal linear combinations that maximize the total variance.
