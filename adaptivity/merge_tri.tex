% why
Due to the property of the SBFEM, first order triangle element will result identical eigenvalues of one.
Under this circumstances, the displacement, nodal forces and energy using eigenvalues failed as the they are always equal to the order of the shape function, one.
As a consequence, the triangular elements shall be merged with their neighbours to form a larger polygon.
