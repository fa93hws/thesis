\section{Conclusions}
\paragraph{}
In this chapter, the machine learning algorithm is adopted to develop an extensible and flexible error indicator.
Any other error estimators can be added to the existing framework and their effects can be detected based on the performance indicators in machine learning.
A MLP trained error estimator that concludes expressions related to the eigenvalues of the SBFEM formulation and some key geometric properties of the scaled boundary finite element give a higher convergence rate compared to the uniform refinement.
In order to improve the learning effectiveness of the MLP, regularization methods including bagging and dropout are utilized.
Due to the lack of the eigenvalue error indicator in the first order triangular element, method that eliminates these situation is developed.
A matrix representation of the NURBS curves is presented to achieve a higher efficiency and stability in calculating the intersections between edge\hl{s} of the element and the NURBS curve.
Stress analysis is conducted on 2D linear elasticity problems.
