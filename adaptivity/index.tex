\section{Conclusions}
\paragraph{}
In this chapter, the machine learning algorithm is adopted to develop an extensible and flexible error indicator.
A MLP trained error estimator that concludes expressions related to the eigenvalues of the SBFEM formulation and some key geometric properties of the scaled boundary finite element gives a higher convergence rate compared to the uniform refinement.
In order to improve the learning effectiveness of the MLP, regularization methods including bagging and dropout are adopted.
Due to the lack of eigenvalue error indicator in first order triangular element, method that eliminates these situation is produced.
A matrix representation of NURBS curves is presented to achieve a higher efficiency and stability in calculating the intersections between lines and NURBS curve.
Stress analysis is conducted on 2D linear elasticity problems.
