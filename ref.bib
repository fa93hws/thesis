abstract = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors.

abstract = {SUMMARYA displacement‐based continuous‐Galerkin finite element formulation for general polyhedra is presented for applications in nonlinear solid mechanics. The polyhedra can have an arbitrary number of vertices or faces. The faces of the polyhedra can have an arbitrary number of edges and can be nonplanar. The polyhedra can be nonconvex with only the mild restriction of star convexity with respect to the vertex‐averaged centroid. Conforming shape functions are constructed using harmonic functions defined on the undeformed configuration, thus requiring the use of a total‐Lagrangian finite element formulation in large deformation applications. For nonlinear applications with computationally intensive constitutive models, it is important to minimize the number of element quadrature points. For this reason, an integration scheme is adopted in which the number of quadrature points is equal to the number of vertices. As a first step toward verifying the element behavior in the general nonlinear setting, several linear verification examples are presented using both random Voronoi meshes and distorted hexahedral meshes. For the hexahedral meshes, results for the polyhedral formulation are compared to those of the standard trilinear hexahedral formulation. The element behavior in the nearly incompressible regime is also examined. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We introduce and study a new implicit representation of rational B{\'{e}}zier curves and surfaces in the 3-dimensional space. Given such a curve or surface, this representation consists of a matrix whose entries depend on the space variables and whose rank drops exactly on this curve or surface. Our approach can be seen as an extension of the moving lines implicitization method introduced by Sederberg, from non-singular matrices to the more general context of singular matrices. In the first part of this paper, we describe the construction of these new implicit matrix representations and their main geometric properties, in particular their ability to solve efficiently the inversion problem. The second part of this paper aims to show that these implicitization matrices adapt geometric problems, such as intersection problems, to the powerful tools of numerical linear algebra, in particular to one of the most important: the singular value decomposition. So, from the singular values of a given implicit matrix representation, we introduce a real evaluation function. We show that the variation of this function is qualitatively comparable to the Euclidean distance function. As an interesting consequence, we obtain a new determinantal formula for implicitizing a rational space curve or surface over the field of real numbers. Then, we show that implicit matrix representations can be used with numerical computations, in particular there is no need for symbolic computations to use them. We give some rigorous results explaining the numerical stability that we have observed in our experiments. We end the paper with a short illustration on ray tracing of parameterized surfaces. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As well as making the method more accessible, this approach leads to new techniques for the treatment of body loads, side-face loads and axisymmetry that simplify implementation. The paper fully develops the new formulation, and provides four examples illustrating the versatility, accuracy and efficiency of the scaled boundary finite-element method.

abstract = {This paper presents a new method to balance binary search trees, which has the following properties. (i) The only information stored for the balance is the size of every subtree. (ii) Inserting or deleting an element can be done in the most traditional way: first, the element is recursively inserted (deleted) in (from) the appropriate subtree; afterwards, a single or double rotation takes place if necessary. (iii) Checking whether or not those rotations are required is computable in constant time per visited node. (iv) The worst-case height of these trees is never worse than approximately 1.44042log2n, where n is the number of elements. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
