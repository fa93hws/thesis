abstract = {A polyhedral mesh generation from standard tessellation language (STL) models is presented for the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM). The STL format is widely used in 3D printing and computer-aided design (CAD) systems to describe the surface geometry of a 3D object. An STL model for visualisation usually has flaws and is incompatible with mesh generators developed for the finite element method (FEM), such as those found in Abaqus, ANSYS, etc. In this paper, we combine an octree-based polyhedral mesh generation with the SBFEM to perform automatic stress analyses of STL models. As the SBFEM has the capability to model an arbitrary polyhedron by discretising its boundary only, the mesh generation effort is significantly reduced. The basic idea of the proposed method is first creating an octree grid that encloses an STL model and then trimming the grid by the STL surface. The trimming process follows a bottom-up scheme starting from the edges, faces to cells. Within the same framework, a recovery method for sharp features is also developed. It can reconstruct hard edges and points when they are required to be explicitly represented in a mesh. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient, hierarchical high-order enrichment approach for the finite cell method applied to problems of solid mechanics involving discontinuities and singularities. In contrast to the standard extended finite element method, where new degrees of freedom are introduced for all finite elements located in the enrichment zone, we define the enrichment on a so-called overlay mesh which is superimposed over the base mesh. The approximation on the base mesh is obtained by means of the finite cell method where the hp-d method is employed to introduce the hierarchical extension on the overlay mesh. We present two different strategies for defining the enrichment on the superimposed overlay mesh. In the first approach, the enrichment is based on a local h-, p- or hp-refinement utilizing the finite element method on the overlay mesh. Alternatively, the enrichment is constructed by means of the partition of unity method introducing carefully selected enrichment functions suitable for the problem at hand. Our results reveal that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the finite cell method significantly with only a minimum number of additional degrees of freedom. In this paper we will focus on examples with material interfaces although the method can also be applied to problems involving strong discontinuities and singularities. Accurate stress distribution and an exponential rate of convergence are the two striking characteristics of the proposed method. Due to the hierarchical approach it paves the way to using different approaches for the approximation on the base and the overlay mesh and accordingly allows multiscale problems to be addressed as well.},

abstract = {Huge effort has been spent over the past decades to develop efficient numerical methods for topology optimization of mechanical structures. Most recent investigations have focused on increasing the efficiency and robustness, improving the optimization schemes and extending them to multidisciplinary objective functions. The vast majority of available methods is based on low order finite elements, assuming one element as the smallest entity which can be assigned material in the optimization process. Whereas the present paper uses only a very simple, heuristic optimization procedure, it investigates in detail the feasibility of high order elements for topology optimization. The Finite Cell Method, an extension of the p-version of FEM is used, which completely separates between the description of the geometry of a structure and cells, where the high order shape functions are defined. Whereas geometry is defined on a (very) fine mesh, the material grid, shape functions live on a much coarser grid of elements, the finite cells. The method takes advantage of the ability of high order elements to accurately approximate even strongly inhomogeneous material distribution within one element and thus boundaries between material and void which pass through the interior of the coarse cells. Very attractive properties of the proposed method can be observed: Due to the high order approach the stress field in the optimized structure is approximated very accurately, no checkerboarding is observed, the iteratively found boundary of the structure is very smooth and the observed number of iterations is in general very small.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The finite cell method (FCM) combines the fictitious domain approach with the p-version of the finite element method and adaptive integration. For problems of linear elasticity, it offers high convergence rates and simple mesh generation, irrespective of the geometric complexity involved. This article presents the integration of the FCM into the framework of nonlinear finite element technology. However, the penalty parameter of the fictitious domain is restricted to a few orders of magnitude in order to maintain local uniqueness of the deformation map. As a consequence of the weak penalization, nonlinear strain measures provoke excessive stress oscillations in the cells cut by geometric boundaries, leading to a low algebraic rate of convergence. Therefore, the FCM approach is complemented by a local overlay of linear hierarchical basis functions in the sense of the hp-d method, which synergetically uses the h-adaptivity of the integration scheme. Numerical experiments show that the hp-d overlay effectively reduces oscillations and permits stronger penalization of the fictitious domain by stabilizing the deformation map. The hp-d-adaptive FCM is thus able to restore high convergence rates for the geometrically nonlinear case, while preserving the easy meshing property of the original FCM. Accuracy and performance of the present scheme are demonstrated by several benchmark problems in one, two, and three dimensions and the nonlinear simulation of a complex foam sample.

abstract = {Finite deformation contact of flexible solids embedded in fluid flows occurs in a wide range of engineering scenarios. We propose a novel three-dimensional finite element approach in order to tackle this problem class. The proposed method consists of a dual mortar contact formulation, which is algorithmically integrated into an eXtended finite element method (XFEM) fluid--structure interaction approach. The combined XFEM fluid--structure-contact interaction method (FSCI) allows to compute contact of arbitrarily moving and deforming structures embedded in an arbitrary flow field. In this paper, the fluid is described by instationary incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. An exact fluid--structure interface representation permits to capture flow patterns around contacting structures very accurately as well as to simulate dry contact between structures. No restrictions arise for the structural and the contact formulation. We derive a linearized monolithic system of equations, which contains the fluid formulation, the structural formulation, the contact formulation as well as the coupling conditions at the fluid--structure interface. The linearized system may be solved either by partitioned or by monolithic fluid--structure coupling algorithms. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the capability of the proposed fluid--structure-contact interaction approach.},

Standard finite elements are used in the major part of the domain and enriched elements are employed where special solution properties such as discontinuities and singularities shall be captured. In elements that blend the enriched areas with the rest of the domain problems arise in general. These blending elements often require a special treatment in order to avoid a decrease in the overall convergence rate. A modification of the XFEM approximation is proposed in this work. The enrichment functions are modified such that they are zero in the standard elements, unchanged in the elements with all their nodes being enriched, and varying continuously in the blending elements. All nodes in the blending elements are enriched. The modified enrichment function can be reproduced exactly everywhere in the domain and no problems arise in the blending elements. The corrected XFEM is applied to problems in linear elasticity and optimal convergence rates are achieved. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

One of them describes the crack as a two-dimensional surface in a three-dimensional space, and the second is used to describe the one-dimensional crack front, which is the intersection of the two level sets. A Hamilton–Jacobi equation is used to update the level sets. A velocity extension is developed that preserves the old crack surface and can accurately generate the growing surface. The technique is coupled with the extended finite element method which approximates the displacement field with a discontinuous partition of unity. This displacement field is constructed directly in terms of the level sets, so the discretization by finite elements requires no explicit representation of the crack surface. Numerical experiments show the robustness of the method, both in accuracy and in treating cracks with significant changes in topology. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A simple yet effective modification to the standard finite element method is presented in this paper. The basic idea is an extension of a partial differential equation beyond the physical domain of computation up to the boundaries of an embedding domain, which can easier be meshed. If this extension is smooth, the extended solution can be well approximated by high order polynomials. This way, the finite element mesh can be replaced by structured or unstructured cells embedding the domain where classical h- or p-Ansatz functions are defined. An adequate scheme for numerical integration has to be used to differentiate between inside and outside the physical domain, very similar to strategies used in the level set method. In contrast to earlier works, e.g., the extended or the generalized finite element method, no special interpolation function is introduced for enrichment purposes. Nevertheless, when using p-extension, the method shows exponential rate of convergence for smooth problems and good accuracy even in the presence of singularities. The formulation in this paper is applied to linear elasticity problems and examined for 2D cases, although the concepts are generally valid.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper introduces a new algorithm called whisker weaving for constructing unstructured, all-hexahedral finite element meshes. Whisker weaving is based on the Spatial Twist Continuum (STC), a global interpretation of the geometric dual of an all-hexahedral mesh. Whisker weaving begins with a closed, all-quadrilateral surface mesh bounding a solid geometry, then constructs hexahedral element connectivity advancing into the solid. The result of the whisker weaving algorithm is a complete representation of hex mesh connectivity only: Actual mesh node locations are determined afterwards. The basic step of whisker weaving is to form a hexahedral element by crossing or intersecting dual entities. This operation, combined with seaming or joining operations in dual space, is sufficient to mesh simple block problems. When meshing more complex geometries, certain other dual entities appear such as blind chords, merged sheets, and self-intersecting chords. Occasionally specific types of invalid connectivity arise. These are detected by a general method based on repeated STC edges. This leads into a strategy for resolving some cases of invalidities immediately. The whisker weaving implementation has so far been successful at generating meshes for simple block-type geometries and for some non-block geometries. Mesh sizes are currently limited to a few hundred elements. While the size and complexity of meshes generated by whisker weaving are currently limited, the algorithm shows promise for extension to much more general problems.},

abstract = {Abstract A posteriori error estimation for the boundary element method is developed. The nodal error is estimated from the difference of two solutions—one from the original BEM solution, and the other from interpolation of the original solution. Based on nodal errors, a matrix analysis is carried out to calculate the corresponding errors at source points. Two formulae for estimating global percentage errors are proposed in the paper. The first formula uses nodal errors directly to estimate element error, and the second uses an integral form to calculate element error to eliminate extremely high mesh concentration near areas with singular solutions. An h-version adaptive mesh refinement is implemented to study the accuracy of the proposed error estimation. Numerical examples show that the error estimator can correctly guide mesh refinement, and a final mesh can be obtained in a few iterations. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

It is shown that, by solving appropriate local residual type problems, one can obtain upper bounds on the error in the energy norm. Moreover, in the special case of adaptiveh-p finite element analysis, the estimator will also give a realistic estimate of the error. A key feature of this is the development of a systematic approach to the determination of boundary conditions for the local problems. The work extends and combines several existing methods to the case of fullh-p finite element approximation on possibly irregular meshes with, elements of non-uniform degree. As a special case, the analysis proves a conjecture made by Bank and Weiser [Some A Posteriori Error Estimators for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations, Math. Comput.44, 283--301 (1985)].},

abstract = {Abstract This is the first of two papers concerning superconvergent recovery techniques and a posteriori error estimation. In this paper, a general recovery technique is developed for determining the derivatives (stresses) of the finite element solutions at nodes. The implementation of the recovery technique is simple and cost effective. The technique has been tested for a group of widely used linear, quadratic and cubic elements for both one and two dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the recovered nodal values of the derivatives with linear and cubic elements are superconvergent. One order higher accuracy is achieved by the procedure with linear and cubic elements but two order higher accuracy is achieved for the derivatives with quadratic elements. In particular, an O(h4) convergence of the nodal values of the derivatives for a quadratic triangular element is reported for the first time. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with the widely used smoothing procedure of global L2 projection and other methods. It is found that the derivatives recovered at interelement nodes, by using L2 projection, are also superconvergent for linear elements but not for quadratic elements. Numerical experiments on the convergence of the recovered solutions in the energy norm are also presented. Higher rates of convergence are again observed. The results presented in this part of the paper indicate clearly that a new, powerful and economical process is now available which should supersede the currently used post-processing procedures applied in most codes.},

abstract = {Abstract A concurrent multigrid method is devised for the direct estimation of stress intensity factors and higher-order coefficients of the elastic crack tip asymptotic field. The proposed method bridges three characteristic length scales that can be present in fracture mechanics: the structure, the crack and the singularity at the crack tip. For each of them, a relevant model is proposed. First, a truncated analytical reduced-order model based on Williams' expansion is used to describe the singularity at the tip. Then, it is coupled with a standard extended finite element (FE) method model which is known to be suitable for the scale of the crack. A multigrid solver finally bridges the scale of the crack to that of the structure for which a standard FE model is often accurate enough.

abstract = {Abstract A multiscale method for 3-D crack propagation simulation in large structures is proposed. The method is based on the extended finite element method (X-FEM). The asymptotic behavior of the crack front is accurately modeled using enriched elements and no remeshing is required during crack propagation. However, the different scales involved in fracture mechanics problems can differ by several orders of magnitude and industrial meshes are usually not designed to account for small cracks. Enrichments are therefore useless if the crack is too small compared with the element size. To overcome this drawback, a project combining different numerical techniques was started. The first step was the implementation of a global multigrid algorithm within the X-FEM framework and was presented in a previous paper (Eur. J. Comput. Mech. 2007; 16:161–182). This work emphasized the high efficiency in cpu time but highlighted that mesh refinement is required on localized areas only (cracks, inclusions, steep gradient zones). This paper aims at linking the different scales by using a local multigrid approach. The coupling of this technique with the X-FEM is described and computational aspects dealing with intergrid operators, optimal multiscale enrichment strategy and level sets are pointed out. Examples illustrating the accuracy and efficiency of the method are given. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract An improvement of a new technique for modelling cracks in the finite element framework is presented. A standard displacement-based approximation is enriched near a crack by incorporating both discontinuous fields and the near tip asymptotic fields through a partition of unity method. A methodology that constructs the enriched approximation from the interaction of the crack geometry with the mesh is developed. This technique allows the entire crack to be represented independently of the mesh, and so remeshing is not necessary to model crack growth. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the utility and robustness of the proposed technique. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Summary This paper presents a novel numerical framework based on the generalized finite element method with global–local enrichments (GFEMgl) for two-scale simulations of propagating fractures in three dimensions. A non-linear cohesive law is adopted to capture objectively the dissipated energy during the process of material degradation without the need of adaptive remeshing at the macro scale or artificial regularization parameters. The cohesive crack is capable of propagating through the interior of finite elements in virtue of the partition of unity concept provided by the generalized/extended finite element method, and thus eliminating the need of interfacial surface elements to represent the geometry of discontinuities and the requirement of finite element meshes fitting the cohesive crack surface. The proposed method employs fine-scale solutions of non-linear local boundary-value problems extracted from the original global problem in order to not only construct scale-bridging enrichment functions but also to identify damaged states in the global problem, thus enabling accurate global solutions on coarse meshes. This is in contrast with the available GFEMgl in which the local solution field contributes only to the kinematic description of global solutions. The robustness, efficiency, and accuracy of this approach are demonstrated by results obtained from representative numerical examples. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{doi:10.1002/nme.4580,
abstract = {SUMMARYThe mapping method was introduced in Jeong et al. (2013) for highly accurate isogeometric analysis (IGA) of elliptic boundary value problems containing singularities. The mapping method is concerned with constructions of novel geometrical mappings by which push-forwards of B-splines from the parameter space into the physical space generate singular functions that resemble the singularities. In other words, the pullback of the singularity into the parameter space by the novel geometrical mapping (a non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) surface mapping) becomes highly smooth. One of the merits of IGA is that it uses NURBS functions employed in designs for the finite element analysis. However, push-forwards of rational NURBS may not be able to generate singular functions. Moreover, the mapping method is effective for neither the k-refinement nor the h-refinement. In this paper, highly accurate stress analysis of elastic domains with cracks and ∕ or corners are achieved by enriched IGA, in which push-forwards of NURBS via the design mapping are combined with push-forwards of B-splines via the novel geometrical mapping (the mapping technique). In a similar spirit of X-FEM (or GFEM), we propose three enrichment approaches: enriched IGA for corners, enriched IGA for cracks, and partition of unity IGA for cracks.

abstract = {Abstract The scaled boundary finite-element method (a novel semi-analytical method for solving linear partial differential equations) involves the solution of a quadratic eigenproblem, the computational expense of which rises rapidly as the number of degrees of freedom increases. Consequently, it is desirable to use the minimum number of degrees of freedom necessary to achieve the accuracy desired. Stress recovery and error estimation techniques for the method have recently been developed. This paper describes an h-hierarchical adaptive procedure for the scaled boundary finite-element method. To allow full advantage to be taken of the ability of the scaled boundary finite-element method to model stress singularities at the scaling centre, and to avoid discretization of certain adjacent segments of the boundary, a sub-structuring technique is used. The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated through a set of examples. The procedure is compared with a similar h-hierarchical finite element procedure. Since the error estimators in both cases evaluate the energy norm of the stress error, the computational cost of solutions of similar overall accuracy can be compared directly. The examples include the first reported direct comparison of the computational efficiency of the scaled boundary finite-element method and the finite element method. The scaled boundary finite-element method is found to reduce the computational effort considerably. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new technique for solving concentrated load problems in the scaled boundary finite element method (FEM). By employing fundamental solutions for the displacements and the stresses, the solution is computed as summation of a fundamental solution part and a regular part. The singularity at the point of load application is modelled exactly by the fundamental solution, and only the regular part, which enforces the boundary conditions of the domain onto the fundamental solution, needs to be approximated in the solution space of the scaled boundary FEM. Examples are provided illustrating that the new approach is much simpler to implement and more accurate than the method currently used for solving concentrated load problems with the scaled boundary method. In each illustration, solution convergence is examined. The relative error is described in terms of the scalar energy norm of the stress field. Mesh refinement is performed using p-refinement with high order element based on the Lobatto shape functions. The proposed technique is described for two-dimensional problems in this paper, but extension to any linear problem, for which fundamental solutions exist, is straightforward.},

In this method, the crack can be arbitrarily oriented, but its growth is represented discretely by activation of crack surfaces at individual particles, so no representation of the crack's topology is needed. The crack is modelled by a local enrichment of the test and trial functions with a sign function (a variant of the Heaviside step function), so that the discontinuities are along the direction of the crack. The discontinuity consists of cylindrical planes centred at the particles in three dimensions, lines centred at the particles in two dimensions. The model is applied to several 2D problems and compared to experimental data. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The proposed method does not require special numerical integration technique to compute the stiffness matrix, and it improves the capability of the XFEM to model cracks in homogeneous and/or heterogeneous materials without a priori knowledge of the asymptotic solutions. A Heaviside enrichment is used to represent the jump across the discontinuity surface. We call the method as the extended SBFEM. Numerical results presented for a few benchmark problems in the context of linear elastic fracture mechanics show that the proposed method yields accurate results with improved condition number. A simple code is annexed to compute the terms in the stiffness matrix, which can easily be integrated in any existing FEM/XFEM code. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents and exercises a general structure for an object-oriented-enriched finite element code. The programming environment provides a robust tool for extended finite element (XFEM) computations and a modular and extensible system. The programme structure has been designed to meet all natural requirements for modularity, extensibility, and robustness. To facilitate mesh–geometry interactions with hundreds of enrichment items, a mesh generator and mesh database are included. The salient features of the programme are: flexibility in the integration schemes (subtriangles, subquadrilaterals, independent near-tip, and discontinuous quadrature rules); domain integral methods for homogeneous and bi-material interface cracks arbitrarily oriented with respect to the mesh; geometry is described and updated by level sets, vector level sets or a standard method; standard and enriched approximations are independent; enrichment detection schemes: topological, geometrical, narrow-band, etc.; multi-material problem with an arbitrary number of interfaces and slip-interfaces; non-linear material models such as J2 plasticity with linear, isotropic and kinematic hardening. To illustrate the possible applications of our paradigm, we present 2D linear elastic fracture mechanics for hundreds of cracks with local near-tip refinement, and crack propagation in two dimensions as well as complex 3D industrial problems.

abstract = {SUMMARY An automatic crack propagation modelling technique using polygon elements is presented. A simple algorithm to generate a polygon mesh from a Delaunay triangulated mesh is implemented. The polygon element formulation is constructed from the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM), treating each polygon as a SBFEM subdomain and is very efficient in modelling singular stress fields in the vicinity of cracks. Stress intensity factors are computed directly from their definitions without any nodal enrichment functions. An automatic remeshing algorithm capable of handling any n-sided polygon is developed to accommodate crack propagation. The algorithm is simple yet flexible because remeshing involves minimal changes to the global mesh and is limited to only polygons on the crack paths. The efficiency of the polygon SBFEM in computing accurate stress intensity factors is first demonstrated for a problem with a stationary crack. Four crack propagation benchmarks are then modelled to validate the developed technique and demonstrate its salient features. The predicted crack paths show good agreement with experimental observations and numerical simulations reported in the literature. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A new numerical method, scaled boundary isogeometric analysis (SBIGA) combining the concept of the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) and the isogeometric analysis (IGA), is proposed in this study for 2D elastostatic problems with both homogenous and inhomogeneous essential boundary conditions. Scaled boundary isogeometric transformation is established at a specified scaling center with boundary isogeometric representation identical to the design model imported from CAD system, which can be automatically refined without communication with the original system and keeping geometry invariability. The field variable, that is, displacement, is constructed by the same basis as boundary isogeometric description keeping analytical features in radial direction. A Lagrange multiplier scheme is suggested to impose the inhomogeneous essential boundary conditions. The new proposed method holds the semi-analytical feature inherited from SBFEM, that is, discretization only on boundaries rather than the entire domain, and isogeometric boundary geometry from IGA, which further increases the accuracy of the solution. Numerical examples, including circular cavity in full plane, Timoshenko beam with inhomogenous boundary conditions and infinite plate with circular hole subjected to remotely tension, demonstrate that SBIGA can be applied efficiently to elastostatic problems with various boundary conditions, and powerful in accuracy of solution and less degrees of freedom (DOF) can be achieved in SBIGA than other methods.},

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.},

abstract = {SUMMARYA displacement‐based continuous‐Galerkin finite element formulation for general polyhedra is presented for applications in nonlinear solid mechanics. The polyhedra can have an arbitrary number of vertices or faces. The faces of the polyhedra can have an arbitrary number of edges and can be nonplanar. The polyhedra can be nonconvex with only the mild restriction of star convexity with respect to the vertex‐averaged centroid. Conforming shape functions are constructed using harmonic functions defined on the undeformed configuration, thus requiring the use of a total‐Lagrangian finite element formulation in large deformation applications. For nonlinear applications with computationally intensive constitutive models, it is important to minimize the number of element quadrature points. For this reason, an integration scheme is adopted in which the number of quadrature points is equal to the number of vertices. As a first step toward verifying the element behavior in the general nonlinear setting, several linear verification examples are presented using both random Voronoi meshes and distorted hexahedral meshes. For the hexahedral meshes, results for the polyhedral formulation are compared to those of the standard trilinear hexahedral formulation. The element behavior in the nearly incompressible regime is also examined. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We introduce and study a new implicit representation of rational B{\'{e}}zier curves and surfaces in the 3-dimensional space. Given such a curve or surface, this representation consists of a matrix whose entries depend on the space variables and whose rank drops exactly on this curve or surface. Our approach can be seen as an extension of the moving lines implicitization method introduced by Sederberg, from non-singular matrices to the more general context of singular matrices. In the first part of this paper, we describe the construction of these new implicit matrix representations and their main geometric properties, in particular their ability to solve efficiently the inversion problem. The second part of this paper aims to show that these implicitization matrices adapt geometric problems, such as intersection problems, to the powerful tools of numerical linear algebra, in particular to one of the most important: the singular value decomposition. So, from the singular values of a given implicit matrix representation, we introduce a real evaluation function. We show that the variation of this function is qualitatively comparable to the Euclidean distance function. As an interesting consequence, we obtain a new determinantal formula for implicitizing a rational space curve or surface over the field of real numbers. Then, we show that implicit matrix representations can be used with numerical computations, in particular there is no need for symbolic computations to use them. We give some rigorous results explaining the numerical stability that we have observed in our experiments. We end the paper with a short illustration on ray tracing of parameterized surfaces. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper develops a new virtual work formulation and modal interpretation of the method for elastostatics. This formulation follows a similar procedure to the traditional virtual work derivation of the standard finite element method. As well as making the method more accessible, this approach leads to new techniques for the treatment of body loads, side-face loads and axisymmetry that simplify implementation. The paper fully develops the new formulation, and provides four examples illustrating the versatility, accuracy and efficiency of the scaled boundary finite-element method.

Then, we illustrate the advantages of this representation by addressing several important problems of Computer Aided Geometric Design: the point-on-curve and inversion problems, the computation of singularities and the calculation of the intersection between two rational curves. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.
