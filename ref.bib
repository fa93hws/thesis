abstract = {Given a parameterization of an algebraic rational curve in a projective space of arbitrary dimension, we introduce and study a new implicit representation of this curve which consists in the locus where the rank of a single matrix drops. Then, we illustrate the advantages of this representation by addressing several important problems of Computer Aided Geometric Design: the point-on-curve and inversion problems, the computation of singularities and the calculation of the intersection between two rational curves. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Laurent2014,
abstract = {We introduce and study a new implicit representation of rational B{\'{e}}zier curves and surfaces in the 3-dimensional space. Given such a curve or surface, this representation consists of a matrix whose entries depend on the space variables and whose rank drops exactly on this curve or surface. Our approach can be seen as an extension of the moving lines implicitization method introduced by Sederberg, from non-singular matrices to the more general context of singular matrices. In the first part of this paper, we describe the construction of these new implicit matrix representations and their main geometric properties, in particular their ability to solve efficiently the inversion problem. The second part of this paper aims to show that these implicitization matrices adapt geometric problems, such as intersection problems, to the powerful tools of numerical linear algebra, in particular to one of the most important: the singular value decomposition. So, from the singular values of a given implicit matrix representation, we introduce a real evaluation function. We show that the variation of this function is qualitatively comparable to the Euclidean distance function. As an interesting consequence, we obtain a new determinantal formula for implicitizing a rational space curve or surface over the field of real numbers. Then, we show that implicit matrix representations can be used with numerical computations, in particular there is no need for symbolic computations to use them. We give some rigorous results explaining the numerical stability that we have observed in our experiments. We end the paper with a short illustration on ray tracing of parameterized surfaces. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the introduction of mesh refinement techniques within the non-intrusive patch process. For this, an ad hoc residual based explicit error estimator is built, which is adapted to a multi-scale solution, associated with those non-intrusive mesh refinement technique. Moreover, to reduce the global cost of the process, one introduces an estimate of the convergence error of the non-intrusive algorithm, which allows to reduce the number of iterations. This method is discussed and illustrated in various numerical examples.},

abstract = {The scaled-boundary finite element method is a novel semi-analytical technique, combining the advantages of the finite element and the boundary element methods with unique properties of its own. This paper develops a new virtual work formulation and modal interpretation of the method for elastostatics. This formulation follows a similar procedure to the traditional virtual work derivation of the standard finite element method. As well as making the method more accessible, this approach leads to new techniques for the treatment of body loads, side-face loads and axisymmetry that simplify implementation. The paper fully develops the new formulation, and provides four examples illustrating the versatility, accuracy and efficiency of the scaled boundary finite-element method. Both bounded and unbounded domains are treated, together with problems involving stress singularities.},
