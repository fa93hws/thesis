\subsection{Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)}
\label{lr_sec:NURBS}
\paragraph{}
In the proposed approach, the geometry and the unknown fields are represented by non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS).
In this section, we give a brief overview of NURBS.
For more detailed description and implementation aspects, interested readers can refer to \citep{Pie1997,NGUYEN201589}.
\paragraph{}
% basis function
NURBS are the superset of B-spline functions.
B-spline is short for basis spline and is a generalization of Bézier curves.
A spline function is a piecewise polynomial function of degree $p$ and the points of intersection of such functions are called knots.
The number of knots must be equal to or greater than $p + 1$.
One of the salient features of spline functions is that the functions are continuous at the knots, however, the continuity of the functions can be altered by repeating the knots.
The B-spline functions are parametric functions of the form $F(\eta)$ in which the parameter $\eta$ lies in the parametric space.
The key ingredients in the construction of B-spline functions are: the knot vector (a non decreasing sequence of parameter values, $\eta_i \leq \eta_{i+1}$ , $i = 0,1,\dots,m -1$) and the degree of the curve p. The $i$th B-spline basis function of degree $p$, denoted by $_{i,p}$ is defined as \citep{Pie1997}:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        N_{i,0}(\eta) &=
            \begin{cases}
                1   & \text{if } \eta_i \leq \eta \leq \eta_{i+1}    \\
                0   & \text{else}
            \end{cases}\\
        N_{i,p}(\eta) &= 
            \frac{\eta - \eta_i}{\eta_{i+p}-\eta_i}     N_{i,p-1}(\eta) - 
            \frac{\eta_{i+p+1}-\eta}{\eta_{i+p+1} - \eta_{i+1}}     N_{i+1,p-1}(\eta)
    \end{aligned}
    \label{lr_nurbs_basis}
\end{equation}

The first derivative of the B-spline basis function can be computed recursively from lower order basis functions as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{d\eta} N_{i,p}(\eta) =
        \frac{p}{\eta_{i+p} - \eta_i} N_{i,p-1}(\eta) -
        \frac{p}{\eta_{i+p+1} - \eta_{i+1}} N_{i+1,p-1}(\eta)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{}
% basis properties
The B-spline basis functions has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Non-negativity
    \item Partition of unity, $\sum_i N_{i,p}=1$
    \item Interpolatory at the end points. The last point requires special treatment when imposing non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions [58].
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{}
% curves
Moreover, the spline function has limited support.
Given $n + 1$ control points $(P_0 ,P_1,\dots,P_n )$ and a knot vector 
    $\Xi$ = $\left\{
        \eta_0 ,\eta_1 ,\dots,\eta_m 
    \right\}$, the piecewise polynomial B-spline curve of degree p is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    C(\eta) = \sum_{i=0}^n P_i N_{i,p} (\eta)
\end{equation}

where $P_i$ are the control points.
A B-spline curve has the following information: $n+1$ control points, $m+1$ knots and a degree $p$.
It is noted that $n$,$m$ and $p$ must satisfy $m = n + p + 1$.
The B-spline functions also provide a variety of refinement algorithms, which are essential when employing B-spline functions to discretize the unknown fields.
The analogous $h$ and $p$ refinement can be done by the process of `knot insertion' and `order elevation'.
Another unique feature of the B-spline basis function is that, it is possible to combine the knot insertion and the degree elevation, commonly referred to as ‘k-refinement’ in the literature \citep{Hug2005b}.
Here we briefly discuss the knot insertion and the degree elevation.
For more details, interested readers are referred to \citep{Pie1997,Hug2005b} and references therein.


\subsubsection{Knot insertion}
\label{lr_sec:nurbs_knot_ins}
\paragraph{}
Consider a B-spline basis functions defined on 
$\Xi = \left\{
    \eta_0 ,\eta_1,\dots,\eta_m 
    \right\}$,
let $\overline{\eta} \in [\eta_k ,\eta_{k+1} )$, and insert $\overline{\eta}$ into $\Xi$ to form a new knot vector 
$\overline{\Xi} = \left\{
    \eta_0 ,\dots, \overline{\eta}_k = \eta_k , 
    \overline{\eta}_{k+1} = \overline{\eta}, 
    \overline{\eta}_{k+2} = \overline{\eta}_{k+1} ,
    \dots,\eta_{m+1} = \eta_m
    \right\}$.
Simultaneously, the size of the control points is increased by one. Thus $C(\eta)$ has a representation on $\overline{\Xi}$ of the form
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{C}(\eta) = \sum_{i=0}^{n+1}
                        \overline{N}_{i,p} (\eta)
                        \mathbf{Q}_i
\end{equation}
Where $\mathbf{Q}_i$ is:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{Q}_i = \alpha_i \mathbf{P}_i +
                    (1-\alpha_i) \mathbf{P}_{i-1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \alpha_i =  \begin{cases}
                    1       & i \leq k-p \\
                    \frac{ \overline{\eta} -\eta_i }{ \eta_{i+p} - \eta_i } & k-p \leq i \leq k \\
                    0 & i \geq k+1                          
                \end{cases}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Order elevation}
\label{lr_sec:nurbs_order_ele}
Let $
\mathbf{C}(\eta) =  \sum_{i=0}^n
                    N_{i,p}(\eta)
                    \mathbf{P}_i
$
be a $p$th-degree B-spline curve on the knot vector $\Xi$.
As a piecewise polynomial curve with $p+1$ order, $\mathbf{C}(\eta)$ is expected to be expressed in higher order basis functions.
In other words, another set of control points $Q_i$ and knot vector $\Xi$ should exists such that
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{C}(\eta) =  \sum_{i=0}^{\overline{n}}
                        N_{i, p+1}(\eta)
                        \mathbf{Q}_i
\end{equation}
The procedure to elevate the order of a B-spline is listed as follows \citep{Pie1997}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extract each Bézier segment from the curve
    \item Elevate the order of each Bézier segment
    \item Remove unnecessary knots separating the ($i-1$)th and $i$th segments
\end{enumerate}
When elevating a $p$th Bézier curve, a new set of control points can be determined from:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{Q}_i =  (1-\alpha_i) \mathbf{P}_i +
                    \alpha_i \mathbf{P}_{i-1}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i=\frac{i}{p+i}$, $i=0$, $\dots$, $p+1$.
Fig.~\ref{lr_fig:nurbs_knotins} and Fig.~\ref{lr_fig:nurbs_orderele} show an example of basis function when performing a knot insertion and order elevation, respectively.

    \caption{B-spline functoins: order elevation}
    \label{lr_fig:nurbs_orderele}
\end{figure}

Besides, it is found that if the order is elevated to $q$ and only then inserted a unique knot value, the basis would have $q-1$ continuous derivatives at the knot we inserted and this process is called $k$-refinement \citep{Hug2005b}.
Despite the flexibility offered by the B-splines, they lack the ability to exactly represent some shapes such as circle and ellipsoids.
To improve this, non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) are formed through rational functions of B-splines.
The NURBS thus form the superset of B-splines.
The key ingredients in the construction of NURBS basis functions are: the knot vector (a non decreasing sequence of parameter values, $\eta_i \leq \eta_{i+1}$, $i=0,1$,$\dots$, $m-1$), the degree of the curve $p$ and the weight associated to a control point, $w$.
A $p$th degree NURBS basis function is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    R(\eta) =   \frac{ N_{i,p}(\eta) w_i }{W(\eta)}
            =   \frac{ N_{i,p}(\eta) w_i }{
                    \sum_{i=0}^{n} N_{i,p}(\eta)w_i
                }
\label{iso_eq:rational_basis_function}
\end{equation}
where $w_i$ are the weights for the $i$th basis function $N_{i,p}(\eta)$.
Fig.~\ref{lr_fig:nurbs_rational_basis} shows the third order NURBS for an open knot vector.

    \caption{3rd NURBS for an open knot vector $\Xi$ = \{ -1, -1, -1, -1, -1/3, -1/3, -1/3, 0, 1/3, 1, 1, 1, 1 \}. Note that the functions are only interpolatory at the end points}
    \label{lr_fig:nurbs_rational_basis}
\end{figure}

The first derivative of a NURBS basis function is computed using the quotient rule and is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{d\eta}R_{i,p}(\eta) =  w_i\frac{
        N^\prime_{i,p}(\eta)W(\eta) - N_{i,p}(\eta) W^\prime(\eta)
    }{W(\eta)^2}
\end{equation}
