In some situations, the FEM mesh can be so locally coarse that some localized phenomena can not be captured.
Adaptive mesh generation in such case during the pre-processing can be neither possible nor feasible in these cases but the numerical analysis still need to be performed without losing accuracy significantly. 
For example, if the mesh is so coarse that the local scale phenomena (crack for example) can not be taken into account, X-FEM \citep{Moes1999} or the Generalized FEM \citep{STROUBOULIS20014081,doi:10.1002/nme.4954} are proposed to enrich the model.
Others developed the multigrid algorithms which permits relevant computations while keeping the computational cost acceptable to solve this problem \citep{doi:10.1002/nme.2427, doi:10.1002/nme.3037}.
However, only ad-hoc softwares support enriched finite element model or multigrid \citep{Duval2018}, which leads to the fact that these methods may not be applicable to all circumstances, especially for the users of the softwares that lack of such features.

As a consequence, methods using a posteriori error estimator to refine the mesh adaptively is proposed and widely adopted in FEM \citep{Duval2018, doi:10.1002/gamm.201490020,PRUDHOMME20091887,BAUMAN2009799, doi:10.1002/nme.1620121010, doi:10.1002/nme.1620240618,Oden1989,doi:10.1002/nme.1620240206,doi:10.1002/nme.1620330702,doi:10.1002/nme.1620330703, BOROOMAND1999127, ZIENKIEWICZ1999111, Ainsworth1993} and BEM \citep{Zhao1998, Guiggiani1990, KAMIYA1992223, KITA199421,ZHAO1999793,KITA2000317}.
A posteriori error estimator using stress recovery technique for the SBFEM is also proposed \citep{NME:NME439}.
However, some of these error estimator requires extra work such as stress recovery.
Besides, it could be difficult to determine the most suitable error indicator to a given problem.
Recently, machine learning and deep neural network introduced in Sec.~\ref{lr_sec:machine_learning} allow the usage of multiple error indicators \citep{SaeedIqbal;Graham.F.Carey2005}, while only the geometric properties are considered and the lack of physical indicators limits the accuracy of the estimator.
