\section{Conclusions}
\paragraph{}
This chapter has summarized the linear theory of the Isogeometric analysis, together with a brief introduction on NURBS and its mathematical backgrounds, potentials and limitation.
A brief introduction on the IGES file is also presented.
Due to the dimensional mismatch, the SBFEM is the technique which can provide a seamless integration with the CAD modeling.
As a consequence, the SBFEM is enhanced with the idea of Isogeometric Analysis, automatic mesh generation and adaptive mesh refinement.
The concept of adaptive mesh refinement and its limitation is presented as well.
The MLP then is introduced to overcome this limitation by the adoption of multiple error indicators.
Finally, algorithms used to generate octree mesh in 3D from STL file is presented.
