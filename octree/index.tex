\section{Intersection}
\paragraph{}
Instead of projected all points located on the boundary surfaces to the NURBS surfaces, the exact geometry can be retained by calculating the intersection points directly.
By utilizing the work from Sec.~\ref{oct_sc:surface_division}, the number of the surfaces which may contain the intersection can be limited to a few by determine the relationship between their convex hulls and the line.
Only surfaces whose convex hull has intersection with the line will be selected as candidates.
The number of the candidates increase when the mesh becomes coarser as a longer line segment tends to intersect more convex hulls.
On the other hand, when the mesh is refined and the line segment becomes significantly shorter, the number of the candidates decreases at the same time.
A considerable improvement in computational cost can be expected as the time complexity is only meaningful when numerous intersections are calculated.
Only a few intersections need to be determined when the mesh is coarse hence having quite a few candidates at this circumstance may not significantly increase the computational time.
